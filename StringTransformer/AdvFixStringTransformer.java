/*
Changes and improvements made:

    Usage of CopyOnWriteArrayList: Instead of synchronizing methods or using locks, CopyOnWriteArrayList is used to ensure thread safety
    without explicit synchronization. It is particularly useful when the list is read frequently but modified infrequently.

    ExecutorService: ExecutorService is used to manage the threads instead of creating threads manually. 
    This simplifies the code and provides better control over thread management.

    Callable Tasks: Callable tasks are created for each transformation function. 
    These tasks are submitted to the executor, which handles their execution.

    Graceful Shutdown: The executor is properly shut down in a finally block to ensure
    resources are released even if an exception occurs during execution.

    Null Handling: null values returned by the transform method are filtered out before updating the data list.
